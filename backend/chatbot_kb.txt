"What is the speed limit on this road?",  "The speed limit on this road is 50 km/h."
"What is multipoint tracing?",  "Multipoint tracing tracks a vehicle across multiple checkpoints to analyze its route and behavior."
"What are the common traffic violations?", ""Common violations include speeding, illegal turns, red light running, and improper lane changes."
"How do you identify tailgating?",  "Tailgating is detected when a vehicle follows another vehicle too closely, violating safe distance rules."
"What should the system do if a vehicle exceeds speed limits?",  "The system flags the violation and logs vehicle ID, timestamp, and location for further action."
"How accurate is your violation detection?",  "Our system uses multiple videos and historical data to ensure accuracy in violation detection."
"How to report a violation?",  "Violations detected are automatically logged and can be reviewed by traffic authorities via the dashboard."
"What data is collected during vehicle tracing?",  "We collect vehcile position, speed, lane changes, and vehicle IDs at each checkpoint."
"What happens if a vehicle changes lanes abnormally?",  "Illegal lane changes are flagged as violations for further action."
"How does the dashboard display violation data?",  "The dashboard shows vehicle information, violation types, and analysis graphs."
"Can the system handle multiple vehicles simultaneously?",  "Yes, multipoint tracing and violation detection works concurrently for multiple vehicles on the network."
"Is the system scalable for large cities?",  "Our architecture supports scalable deployment."
